24447675~{"id":24447675,"type":"comment","by":"minimaxir","time":1599860752,"text":"A variant:<p><i>A blog post titled &quot;The Technical Interview Is an Ego Trip&quot; was submitted to tech forum Hacker News.</i><p><i>Here are the top-rated comments on that submission:</i><p>Here are some more unedited, longer outputs:<p>---<p>&quot;This is a very accurate and useful description of the process of interviewing at most companies. I have seen this for over a decade. The interview is almost always a complete failure from the point of view of the interviewer. They start out with a very simple question, which they then follow up with a more complex version of the same question, but slightly different. The candidate is supposed to realize that this is a follow-up, and answer it correctly. The interviewer may take notes. The interviewer is supposed to realize that the candidate is able to recognize the pattern, and answer correctly. So the candidate is asked a number of questions, and at the end of them, the interviewer feels that they have learned whether the candidate is smart enough to be hired. This is obviously a very flawed process, because it&#x27;s very easy to fool the interviewer. If you study the candidate&#x27;s manner, you can tell if they are intimidated and trying to please you, or if they are confident and trying to impress you. Or if they are just bored, and hoping you will end the interview. It&#x27;s very easy to fake the answers to questions, too. Most people don&#x27;t know the answers to the questions they are asked in interviews. They could look up the answers on Wikipedia, but they don&#x27;t. They just make something up and go with it. It&#x27;s not like the interview is going to check. It&#x27;s not like the interview is going to test the candidate&#x27;s knowledge on the spot.&quot;<p>&quot;All of these comments are eerily familiar because they echo my own experience. I&#x27;ve interviewed hundreds of candidates over the past ten years. I&#x27;ve sat on hiring committees for some of the most in-demand tech jobs. I&#x27;ve hired some amazing people and I&#x27;ve hired some terrible people.<p>As a general rule, both the good and the bad candidates have the same attitude.<p>What I&#x27;m talking about is the attitude that a candidate comes into an interview with. You can&#x27;t see it, but I can. It&#x27;s the attitude that a candidate projects over email, phone, and Slack. It&#x27;s the attitude that I can tell when a candidate&#x27;s voice is shaking because they&#x27;re nervous but they&#x27;re trying to hide it. That attitude is the one that says &quot;I&#x27;m awesome and you should hire me, and if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re a fool.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not a coincidence that the candidates that I&#x27;ve come to like or even love the most have been the ones who come in with a humble attitude. These are the candidates that don&#x27;t care if they get the job because they&#x27;re happy to have an opportunity to interview. They don&#x27;t need to prove themselves. They don&#x27;t need to be the smartest person in the room. They don&#x27;t need to fight for the job.&quot;<p>&quot;From a former interviewer:<p>As an interviewer, I&#x27;m totally biased towards the candidate. I want to like them and I want to give them the benefit of the doubt when they don&#x27;t know something. I want to believe that they&#x27;re a good person. I want to think that if they&#x27;re not a good culture fit, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re just having a bad day. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt. I don&#x27;t want them to be bad. I want to think that if they&#x27;re bad, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re just young and inexperienced and they&#x27;ll get better.<p>And as a candidate, you have no idea whether you&#x27;re being interviewed by one of those people. You never know whether you&#x27;re talking to the one who&#x27;s going to be completely honest, or whether you&#x27;re talking to the one who&#x27;s going to try to tell you what they think you want to hear.&quot;","parent":24447598,"kids":[24448662],"parts":[]}

The default davinci model for the OpenAI API is the same model for everyone using it; the few-shot prompts merely guide GPT-3 toward a domain and generation schema.<p>2) This approach is essentially a classification problem, with extra steps. That&#x27;s not new with GPT-3; causal language models (including GPT-2) use classification tasks as a way to quantify model performance (see the papers). Hugging Face transformers is a good library to finetune Transformers specifically for classification tasks.<p>3) The full string &quot;yo be real&quot; is inefficient if you&#x27;re just checking for positive&#x2F;negative responses. (Token efficiency will likely be an interesting area of optimizing GPT-3 performance)<p>4) That said, using token prediction probabilities can be useful for assessing model performance (I explicitly duplicated the web UI&#x27;s implementation for my new client: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;minimaxir&#x2F;status&#x2F;1288125135526875146\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;minimaxir&#x2F;status&#x2F;1288125135526875146</a>). However, the prediction probability is often <i>very</i> dependent on previous tokens, including the prompt, so the results are not universally consistent. But there might be more clever outside-the-box approaches using the token probabilities and heuristics...<p>tbh, I wish OpenAI would also return attention weights for each previous token in order to be able to more easily-visualize which tokens have a high influence on generation.","parent":23989215,"kids":[23989910,23990522],"parts":[]}
